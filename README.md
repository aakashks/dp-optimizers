# Differential Privacy

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the differential privacy mechanism in the context of deep learning. The implementation is based on the paper "Preserving Differential Privacy in Deep Neural Networks with Relevance-Based Adaptive Noise Imposition" by Gong et al. (2020) and "Deep learning with Gaussian differential privacy" by Bu et al. (2020). The implementation is tested on the UCI credit card default dataset.
